## Development

### Goal

I always wanted to make a web service which users can search cosmetics and check if it's organic or chemical free etc.


### Web API
I found an API called Make up API which has a lot of cosmetics JSON Data and implemented HTTP requests by using axios.

### Search by keyword
After getting data from API, I made a function method to trigger events for user typing keyword.
Then, got data that matches search text.

### Search by selecting options
By preparing category options, user also can search date with many other options words such as organic,chemical free,dairy free.

## The more things To Do
* User can like each product and save to database.
* User can post their favorite item to the website.
